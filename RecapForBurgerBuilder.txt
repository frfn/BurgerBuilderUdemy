----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Planning App
** Things WILL change, and that's perfectly normal.

- Component Tree / Structure
    Create, design and split into components

- Application State (Data) 
    Data we will be using in our application (this.state({...}))

- Component VS Container
    Which components should be Stateless or Stateful

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Layout

- Draw a UI 
    Draw how the website/application will look like
    Nav bar, header, footer, content, images on page, body

Burger Builder
    Burger Picture (dynamic) - bunch of Styled Divs with CSS
    Contents for burger: add/remove cheese, burger, salad, bacon, etc.
    Checkout button, etc.

    App contains --> 
                    layout components  
                                    --> Toolbar
                                        --> Side drawer toggle
                                        --> Logo
                                        --> Nav items

                                    --> Side drawer
                                        -->

                                    --> Backdrop
                                        -->

                                    --> Props + Children
                                        --> Burger Builder (Stateful/Container Class)
                                            --> Build Control
                                                --> Cheese, Meat, Burger
                                                --> Order Button

                                            --> Burger
                                                --> Ingredients will show under the burger component

                                            --> Modal (price, tax, etc.)
                                                --> Wrapper component

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. State ( Data )

- this.state({ ingredients: { ..code.. }})
    - purchased, totalprice
    - make it simple!

- Manage the state IN BURGER BUILDER, look at 2. Layout to see the location of Burger Builder.

- Optimize? Pure components, shouldComponentUpdate, etc!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating Project.

1. Create components
    Think of components you will need for project/use repeatedly
    - Create Aux.js for adjacent JSX, etc.

2. Form layout of project
    Place components where they should go, what components do you need

3. Create folders for components and see where they will go in your source code structure
    Ex. Burger(w/ other sub folders) is in Components 

4. Build components one by one
    Don't be too thorough, just see how the component will work with others!

5. Study code
    Every so often, stop and check code + test! 
        Logic, CSS, etc.

6. Burger Overview
    How is it working?
     - App.js --> Layout.js --> BurgerBuilder.js --> Burger.js --> BurgerIngredients.js
        BurgerIngredients.js returns DIVs that are styled, colors and shap has been altered from a rectangle.

7. Burger Overview Pt. II
    Burger has an interesting tranformation array (by Max), makes sense, confusing to follow tbh for people that doesn't know JS.
     - [...Array([props.ingredients[ingredientKey])] <-- results to [ [undefined], [undefined, undefined] ] 
    
     - One array that has multiple arrays... [ []. [], [] ], and in this case, we only care about the length of the array
       we do not care about the values inside array.

8. Learned some JavaScript methods
    - Note reduce can have an INITIAL value ... could be number, object, array, etc. BurgerBuilder uses [] as initial value, and uses .concat() to combine arrays.
    Using .push() without conditional check will give error. BECAUSE IT RETURNS THE LENGTH OF THE ARRAY AND NOT THE ARRAY ITSELF.

     - .reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
         if(currentValue in accumulator){
             accumulator[currentValue]++;
         }
         else {
             accumulator[currentValue] = 1;
         }
         return accumulator;
        }, {})

    - Note that .map can have '_' as blank as an argument that indicates blank, and it will return an array!
     - Here it will return an array of array, objects --> [ [{lol}], [{lol2}], [{lol3}] ]

    The obj.map(key => {
        return [...Array( ..code.. )]
        .map((_, i) => {
            return <JSX />
        }) 
    })
    
9. Added the Burger Control
    How does it work?
     - Less/More button is a <button> with onClick function
        - it takes in an argument, which in this case is 'type'
        - 'type' is collected when the the .map() is initiated in the BuildControl.js
        - When passing, the anonymous function of: () => func(type) is called and passed.
            - when button is clicked, 'type' is passed into the argument and the function runs.
                - FUNCTION takes in argument, grabs the value by this.state.ingredients[type]
                - conditional was created later
                - spread operator was used and the dynamic bracket notation were used
                - price is changed, and I used a Object to keep track of the of price for each item
                - simple calculation of oldPrice + priceOfItem
                - this.setState({...})

    In render?
     - disableLess/disableMore were created
        Grabs the ingredients, then a for loop goes through each one and changes the value to a true or false value
            - it is then passed through components till it hits BuildControl.js and put in 'required={}' inside an HTML button tag

10. Checkout Button
    checkButton state was added, set to false
    created <button> tag in Build Controls, added CSS styling,

    CSS: 
     - new learn:
         - animation: enable–an argument, .4s–the duration of time, linear–kind of animation
         - @keyframes enable { percentages mean the loading of animation from 0% to 100% }

    updatePurchaseState() was added, takes in updatedIngredients argument,
     - called in the methods for adding/deleting ingredients
     - arg is taken because we were taking in OLD STATE which was giving us enexpected behavior

        uses .map() and .reduce()
         - .map() to grab the values inside ingredients obj
         - .reduce() to add the values up
             - if sum is zero, return false.

    In BuildControls.js 
     - disabled={!stateOfButton}
         if TRUE, set disabled, if FALSE, set enabled.
          since sum IS greater than 0, it will be TRUE, we have to !stateOfButton so it is enabled.

11. Modal + Back Drop + Summary
     BurgerBuilder
      - Added new state, 'purchaseNow'
      - Added purchase button METHOD, set 'purchaseNow' to true
      - Modal takes in the show property to see if button has been clicked
      - purchaseHandler is passed to BuildControls
     
     Modal
      - Wrapper, takes in 'show' property
      - It contains the OrderSummary
      - Has animation from inline styling
      - The styling hides it away from the page
      - Without CSS it will display on top of BurgerBuilder.js
      - That is why the Modal can be coded as is in BurgerBuilder.js
        (above all the other Components!)

    Order Summary
     - used .map to return <li> elements
     - inside are key:value pairs
     - DO NOT forget to key the <li key={}> items
     - <span> so we can target the {key} value

    Backdrop
     - Backdrop is just a DIV that is 100% width/height
     - it is in the BACK because of the Z-INDEX: 100
     - MODAL is 500. <-- priority.
     - I passed in a declineHandler that if you click on Backdrop, set to purchase to false.

    Button Component
     - Created our own Button Component so we can reuse!
     - CANCEL button and CONTINUE button in Modal.js
     - CANCEL does exactly what clicking on the backdrop does
     
12. Toolbar
     - Created Navigation folder in Components folder
     - Toolbar.js + CSS
     - Very simple in the beginning
     - Imported to Layout.js
     - Changed CSS in Layout CSS because Toolbar overlaps Burger component
     
    Logo 
     - Downloaded burger-logo.png from Udemy
     - Created Logo folder and Logo.js AND CSS + created folder in Assets --> Images
     - Drag PNG to Images
     - In Toolbar.js, imported the logo!

    Navigation Items
     - This is a <ul> element that will include the NavigationItem component
     - CSS has been added
     - Added to Toolbars.js

        - NavigationItem.js 
         - <li> element with some CSS
         - will go inside NavigationItems.js 
         - .active is a class in CSS!


13. Side Drawer: We click on Menu, should bring out a side drawer
     - Creating side drawer component
         - important code is the CSS 'transform' transition
         - SideDrawer.js is in Layout.js, not in Toolbar.js

     - Responsive changes through CSS
         - Changed height back to 100% for the Logo
         - in respective CSS, changes the .Logo height to preferred
            - User error b/c I had different resolution size (ex. 375 x 667)
            - User error b/c I changed the Layout.module.css to 48px --> 75px .. burger touched border of Toolbar

    
     - Adjust NavigationItems.module.css
         - Main focus is Mobile View so in NavigationItem.js, I changed the base CSS, added an @media query for Desktop View
         - Fixed some CSS for SideDrawer, Toolbar, NavigationItem + NavigationItems
    
     - Adding backdrop when SideDrawer.js is opened for Mobile Device
         - When adding, there has to be a state to see if the SideDrawer has been toggled...
           so... we made Layout.js into a stateful component/class component
         - Error on my part, I passed in a method, and not the value from state. D'oh.
         - I am leaving on creating logic to show sidebar or not.
